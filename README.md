## Project Setup & Commands

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run test:unit
npm run test:e2e:dev
npm run lint
```

## Purpose of the project

This project is inspired from [movies.nuxt.space](https://movies.nuxt.space/). My goal for the next three months is to create a replica of this project without using Nuxt. This will help me to learn Vue and also in the future will be a really useful project for someone who learns Vue and he doesn't want to bother with Nuxt related things.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
